## Figure 1

The soft X-ray instrument normalized response functions (above) and the MESSENGER data set of ~650 flares (below), represented by the spectra at the flare peak. The flare of 1 June, 2007, which is shown in additional detail in Figure 1 of [Dennis 2015](url), is highlighted in red. The range from 2.5-7.5 keV is used in Section 2.2 to fit the MESSENGER spectra.

## Figure 2

Locations of flares as given by HEK/AIA. Flares are color-coded according to the ratio of the theoretical GOES flux calculated from the MESSENGER temperature and emission measure to the actual GOES flux (see Figure \ref{fig:calc} -- MESSENGER/GOES $<$ 1 is cyan and $>$1 is magenta) and the size of the symbol associated with them is directly proportional to the value of the ratio. Events marked with a plus sign indicate those where the measured GOES flux is less than class C2, corresponding to the red triangles in Figure \ref{fig:badflares}.

## Figure 3

Relationship of MESSENGER peak flux to GOES peak flux. Events marked in red are the flares visible to both satellites. The blue shows the line of best fit above a lower threshold (C2 for GOES long, B2 for GOES short).
