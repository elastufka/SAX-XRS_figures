## Figure 1

The soft X-ray instrument normalized response functions (above) and the MESSENGER data set of ~650 flares (below), represented by the spectra at the flare peak. The flare of 1 June, 2007, which is shown in additional detail in Figure 1 of [Dennis 2015](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...803...67D), is highlighted in red. The range from 2.5-7.5 keV is used in Section 2.2 to fit the MESSENGER spectra.

## Figure 2

Locations of flares as given by HEK/AIA. Flares are color-coded according to the ratio of the theoretical GOES flux calculated from the MESSENGER temperature and emission measure to the actual GOES flux (see Figure 4 - MESSENGER/GOES < 1 is cyan and >1 is magenta) and the size of the symbol associated with them is directly proportional to the value of the ratio. Events marked with a plus sign indicate those where the measured GOES flux is less than class C2, corresponding to the red triangles in [Figure 4](#figure-4).

## Figure 3

Relationship of MESSENGER peak flux to GOES peak flux, for events visible to both satellites. The lines of best fit above a lower threshold (C2 for GOES long, B2 for GOES short) are also shown.

## Figure 4

Events which were excluded from the samples above in [Figure 3](#figure-3). Although jointly visible to MESSENGER and GOES, events marked in red were deemed unsuitable for other reasons, described in the text.

## Figure 5

Relationship of GOES-equivalent flux derived from the MESSENGER spectra to the measured GOES flux, for all jointly observed flares above a certain flux threshold (C2 for GOES long, B2 for GOES short). The solid line shows line of best fit, while the dashed line is the 1:1 ratio.

## Figure 6

Temperatures and emission measures calculated for each instrument. MESSENGER values were obtained via OSPEX fit, while GOES quantities were calculated using the SSWIDL routine _goes_teem.pro_, based on empirical data.

## Figure 7

Comparison of SXR fluxes with EUV flux. Lines of best fit are shown in blue. In the top plot, the dashed line indicates the fit found in [Nitta et al. 2013](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-013-0307-7) and begins at the value above which the fit is best (GOES M5.5 or 4x10<sup>6</sup> photons/s in EUV 195 â„«). In the middle plot, it illustrates the derived MESSENGER proxy (Equation 1), after conversion via the EUV-GOES proxy (Equation 5). In the bottom plot, the dashed line indicates the 1:1 ratio.
