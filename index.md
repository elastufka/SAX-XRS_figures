## Figure 1

The soft X-ray instrument normalized response functions (above) and the MESSENGER data set of $\sim$650 flares (below), represented by the spectra at the flare peak. The flare of 1 June, 2007, which is shown in additional detail in Figure 1 of \citet{dennisSOLARFLAREELEMENT2015}, is highlighted in red. The range from 2.5--7.5 keV is used in Section \ref{sec:calc} to fit the MESSENGER spectra.
